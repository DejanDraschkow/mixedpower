# mixedpower

A package for pilot data based simulations for estimationg power in linear mixed models

## Getting started

### 1. Install mixedpower

To set up mixedpower, copy this bit of code and run in in your R-environment:

```R
  if (!require("devtools")) {
    install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)}

   devtools::install_github("DejanDraschkow/mixedpower") 
```

### 2. Use provided pipeline as tutorial 

For a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this package, download the _mixedpower_pipeline.R_ file. 
Everything you need to do and know to run your first mixedpower poweranalysis is explained in there.
