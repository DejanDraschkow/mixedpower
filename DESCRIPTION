Description: Implementation of a simulation based aproach to power analysis. 
    Mixedpower uses pilotdata and a linear mixed model fitted with lme4 to simulate
    new data sets. Power is computed seperate for every effect in the model output 
    as the relation of significant simulations to all simulations. More conservative 
    simulations as a protection against a bias in the pilotdata are available aswell as
    methods for plotting the results.
